- **Easy:** You don't have to worry about writing any boilerplate code!
- **Robust:** The template is robust enough to handle the diverse use-cases you may have.
- **Standardized:** Using this template allows you to make best practices normal and easy to follow.

## Usage

This package is designed to be used with [cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter). Installing cookiecutter can be as easy as:

`pip install cookiecutter --user`

but there are other options as well (see the [cookiecutter documentation](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#install-cookiecutter)).

Once cookiecutter is installed, simply run the following command which will prompt you for some values (which it will use to fill out the template) and create a new, ready-to-go directory for your Sublime Text package in the current working directory.

```shell
# This will ask you to give some input values and will then create a basic
# package for you based on those values in the current directory.
$ cookiecutter https://github.com/agenoria/sublime-snippet-template
```
